How to Play:


Game requires at least 2 screens to play.  Preferably at least one large screen.

Group must split up into 2 teams (red and blue), and each team must then agree on one person to give code words for the round.

One screen must be dedicated to the game board.  This is where all action will happen.  Preferably the bigger screen.  If on mobile, change into landscape mode for best results.

All screens navigate to the main landing page (index.html).  Large Screen:  do not move from this screen yet!

Code Givers: click where prompted, then enter the secret number where prompted.  Check to ensure the word in the green box matches the word under the secret number on the Large Screen.  If not, refresh the page and enter the number again.  Note: if at any point you lose your code, you can click on the code word (top of game page)to display the number again.

Once Code Givers say they are ready, go ahead and head to the Game Board.  The Board will let you know who starts first.

Code Givers:  Look at your code card.  The objective of the game is to have your team flip over all the corresponding words on the game board without flipping over the black card before the other team does.  You do this by associating as many of your words on the table with a word you think up.
Example:  if your team has to guess the words Air, Plane, and Helicopter, you might try to use the word "Aviation", followed by the number "3".  You may only provide one word as a clue, and the number should be the number of cards you think your team should be flipping this turn.
